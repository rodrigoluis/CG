		<h1>Spotlight in Details</h1>

		<p>
			This example shows how to set Threejs' Spotlight and present how to use helpers.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the project below, you can change several parameters of the spotlight like intensity, penumbra, light distance, angle, 
			position of the light and position of its target. You can also change shadows' parameters like shadow map size and
			 the near/far of the shadows' camera.

		<h2>Penumbra resolution</h2>

		<p>
			One important parameter to set is the penumbra. If this parameter is set to zero, the quality of the penumbra 
			will depend on the resolution of the object. Figure 1 shows some possible scenarios. In Figure 1.a penumbra is set to 0.5 and
			that's an interesting value in most of the cases. In Figure 1.b penumbra is set to zero, showing the resolution of the 
			ground plane used. Figura 1.c shows a high resolution ground plane (400 x 400) with penumbra also set to zero. 
			<b>This configuration should be avoided</b> due to its high computational cost. In general, it's better to use 
			the penumbra parameter as 0.5 or higher to produce better visual effects. 
		</p>

				considering a ground plane with resolution 40 x 40. The far right image shows what happens 
				if we set penumbra to zero with a high resolution ground plane (200 x 200).

		<p>
			The 'distance' parameter, when set to zero, light does not attenuate. When distance is non-zero, 
			light will attenuate linearly from maximum intensity at the light's position down to zero at 
			this distance from the light.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, you must set de shadows' map size properly. Higher values give better quality shadows 
			at the cost of computation time. See in Figure 2 what happens if you use the default value 512 (a) or 16 (b)
